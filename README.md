# number-guessing-game
A web-based number guessing game.

Coded for practice.

A simple game in which a random number is generated, and the user must guess the number within ten turns.

The development of the game allowed for the use of variables, loops, conditionals and the definition of functions in JavaScript,
and exposure to the DOM API - methods used icluded querySelector(), focus(), addEventListener(), createElement(), append()
removeChild() and querySelectorAll() methods.
